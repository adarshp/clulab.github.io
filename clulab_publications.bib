    abstract = "We introduce a synthetic dataset called Sentences Involving Complex Compositional Knowledge (SICCK) and a novel analysis that investigates the performance of Natural Language Inference (NLI) models to understand compositionality in logic. We produce 1,304 sentence pairs by modifying 15 examples from the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases – modifiers that correspond to universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, negation, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corresponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models under the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existential quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers.",

Such a dataset is necessary to address the challenge of distinguishing between sexually suggestive content and virtual sex education videos on TikTok. Children{'}s exposure to sexually suggestive videos has been shown to have adversarial effects on their development (Collins et al. 2017). Meanwhile, virtual sex education, especially on subjects that are more relevant to the LGBTQIA+ community, is very valuable (Mitchell et al. 2014). The platform{'}s current system removes/punishes some of both types of videos, even though they serve different purposes. Our dataset contains video URLs, and it is also audio transcribed. To validate its importance, we explore two transformer-based models for classifying the videos. Our preliminary results suggest that the task of distinguishing between these types of videos is learnable but challenging. These experiments suggest that this dataset is meaningful and invites further study on the subject.",

We propose a semi-supervised graph-based algorithm for pattern acquisition that scores patterns and the relations they extract jointly, using a variant of PageRank. We insert light supervision in the form of seed patterns or relations, and model it with several custom teleportation probabilities that bias random-walk scores of patterns/relations based on their proximity to correct information. We evaluate our approach on Few-Shot TACRED, and show that our method outperforms (or performs competitively with) more expensive and opaque deep neural networks. Lastly, we thoroughly compare our proposed approach with the seminal RlogF pattern acquisition algorithm of, showing that it outperforms it for all the hyper parameters tested, in all settings. }",

        such as Morse code) is by far the most common mode of communication
        between humans, and can thus provide significant insight into both
        individual mental states and interpersonal dynamics. As part of
        DARPA{'}s Artificial Social Intelligence for Successful Teams (ASIST)
        program, we are developing an AI agent team member that constructs and
        maintains models of their human teammates and provides appropriate
        task-relevant advice to improve team processes and mission performance.
        One of the key components of this agent is a module that uses a
        rule-based approach to extract task-relevant events from natural
        language utterances in real time, and publish them for consumption by
        downstream components. In this case study, we evaluate the performance
        of our rule-based event extraction system on a recently conducted ASIST
        experiment consisting of a simulated urban search and rescue mission in
        Minecraft. We compare the performance of our approach with that of a
        zero-shot neural classifier, and find that our approach outperforms the
        classifier for all event types, even when the classifier is used in an
        oracle setting where it knows how many events should be extracted from
        each utterance.",

        abstract = {Lexical semantic models provide robust performance for question
answering, but, in general, can only capitalize on direct evidence seen
during training. For example, monolingual alignment models acquire term
alignment probabilities from semi-structured data such as question-answer
pairs; neural network language models learn term embeddings from
unstructured text. All this knowledge is then used to estimate the semantic
similarity between question and answer candidates.  We introduce a
higher-order formalism that allows all these lexical semantic models to
chain direct evidence to construct indirect associations between question
and answer texts, by casting the task as the traversal of graphs that encode
direct term associations.  Using a corpus of 10,000 questions from Yahoo!
Answers, we experimentally demonstrate that higher-order methods are broadly
applicable to alignment and language models, across both word and syntactic
representations. We show that an important criterion for success is
controlling for the semantic drift that accumulates during graph traversal.
All in all, the proposed higher-order approach improves five out of the six
lexical semantic models investigated, with relative gains of up to +13\%
over their first-order variants. },

  abstract = {We introduce a machine learning approach for the identification of ``white spaces'' in scientific knowledge. Our approach addresses this task as link prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such as ``CTCF activates FOXA1'', which were automatically extracted using open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using graph-based features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as from a citation graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated the proposed approach through backtesting. Although the data is heavily unbalanced (50 times more negative examples than positives), our approach predicts which influence links will be discovered in the ``near future'' with a F1 score of 27 points, and a mean average precision of 68\%. },

In this paper, we investigate another potential use of neural TS: assisting machines performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We evaluate the use of neural TS in two ways: simplifying input texts at prediction time and augmenting data to provide machines with additional information during training. We demonstrate that the latter scenario provides positive effects on machine performance on two separate datasets. In particular, the latter use of TS improves the performances of LSTM (1.82{--}1.98{\%}) and SpanBERT (0.7{--}1.3{\%}) extractors on TACRED, a complex, large-scale, real-world relation extraction task. Further, the same setting yields improvements of up to 0.65{\%} matched and 0.62{\%} mismatched accuracies for a BERT text classifier on MNLI, a practical natural language inference dataset.",

Our approach uses a multi-task learning architecture, which jointly trains a classifier for relation extraction, and a sequence model that labels words in the context of the relations that explain the decisions of the relation classifier. We also convert the model outputs to rules to bring global explanations to this approach. This sequence model is trained using a hybrid strategy: supervised, when supervision from pre-existing patterns is available, and semi-supervised otherwise. In the latter situation, we treat the sequence model’s labels as latent variables, and learn the best assignment that maximizes the performance of the relation classifier. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets and show that the sequence model provides labels that serve as accurate explanations for the relation classifier’s decisions, and, importantly, that the joint training generally improves the performance of the relation classifier. We also evaluate the performance of the generated rules and show that the new rules are a great add-on to the manual rules and bring the rule-based system much closer to the neural models.}",

  abstract = {We propose an unsupervised method for the identification of bridge phrases in multi-hop question answering (QA). Our method
constructs a graph of noun phrases from the question and the available context, and applies the Steiner tree algorithm to identify
the minimal sub-graph that connects all question phrases. Nodes in the sub-graph that bridge loosely-connected or disjoint
subsets of question phrases due to low-strength semantic relations are extracted as bridge phrases. The identified bridge phrases
are then used to expand the query based on the initial question, helping in increasing the relevance of evidence that has little
lexical overlap or semantic relation with the question. Through an evaluation on HotpotQA(Yang et al., 2018), a popular dataset
for multi-hop QA, we show that our method yields: (a) improved evidence retrieval, (b) improved QA performance when using
the retrieved sentences; and (c) effective and faithful explanations when answers are provided.},

    abstract = "Extending machine reading approaches to extract mathematical concepts and their descriptions is useful for a variety of tasks, ranging from mathematical information retrieval to increasing accessibility of scientific documents for the visually impaired. This entails segmenting mathematical formulae into identifiers and linking them to their natural language descriptions. We propose a rule-based approach for this task, which extracts LaTeX representations of formula identifiers and links them to their in-text descriptions, given only the original PDF and the location of the formula of interest. We also present a novel evaluation dataset for this task, as well as the tool used to create it.",
